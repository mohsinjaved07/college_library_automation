Abstract / Introduction
 

The library is one of the most important sources of knowledge gathering for students at an educational institute. The basic operations performed in a library are; adding a new member, new books, updating information, searching books, members, and the facility of borrowing and returning books. However, the operations of a library are a very tedious and time-consuming job considering a traditional library system. These operations are performed on daily basis and it consumes a lot of time if you are working with it in registers.

 

To overcome these issues, we need to introduce the concept of automation of libraries at our educational institutes, the library management system is a windows- based application which was developed to make all the operations fast and easy.
